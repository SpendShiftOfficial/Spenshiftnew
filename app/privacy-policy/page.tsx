              <h3>1. Introduction</h3>

              <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains how SpendShift Enterprises Pty Ltd
                ACN 689 089 610 (“SpendShift”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collects,
                holds, uses, discloses and protects personal information in
                connection with www.spendshift.com.au, the SpendShift audit,
                personalised savings reports, payment processing, report
                delivery and related services.
              </p>

              <p>
                We are committed to handling personal information responsibly
                and transparently. Where the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Privacy
                Act”) and the Australian Privacy Principles apply to us, we
                will handle personal information in accordance with those
                requirements. We may also choose to follow comparable privacy
                practices where the Privacy Act does not strictly apply.
              </p>

              <p>
                By using the website or providing personal information to us,
                you acknowledge that your information will be handled as
                described in this Privacy Policy. Where consent is required by
                law, we will seek it separately.
              </p>

              <p>
                We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by
                publishing a revised version on the website. The date at the
                end of the policy shows when it was last updated.
              </p>

              <h3>2. Scope and age restriction</h3>

              <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to visitors to the website, users
                who complete the free audit, customers who purchase a report,
                and anyone who contacts us.
              </p>

              <p>
                SpendShift is intended for people aged 18 years or older. If
                you believe a person under 18 has provided personal information
                to us, contact us so we can assess and, where appropriate,
                delete it.
              </p>

              <h3>3. Personal information we collect</h3>

              <p>Depending on how you use SpendShift, we may collect:</p>

                  comparison habits, mobile or internet plan review habits,
                  recurring payments, unplanned purchases and stated financial

                </li>

                <li>
                  your email address, including the email address collected

                </li>

                <li>

                  transaction metadata;

                <li>
                  communications you send to us, including support, refund,
                  privacy or complaint requests;
                </li>

                <li>

                  pages viewed, approximate location, session information,
                  timestamps and website interaction data collected through
                  server logs, hosting systems and Google Analytics;
                </li>

                <li>
                  cookie and similar technology information described in our
                  Cookie Policy; and
                </li>

                <li>any other information you voluntarily provide to us.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                SpendShift does not receive or store your any payment card
                number or security code. Those details are handled by Stripe
                and, where used, Apple Pay and other relevant financial
                institutions.
              </p>

              <h3>4. How we collect personal information</h3>

              <p>We may collect personal information:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  directly from you when you complete the audit, purchase a
                  report, enter an email address, contact us or request support;
                </li>

                <li>
                  automatically when you browse or interact with the website,
                  through cookies, analytics, server logs and similar
                  technologies;
                </li>

                <li>
                  from Stripe in connection with checkout, payment confirmation,
                  fraud prevention, chargebacks and refunds;
                </li>

                <li>
                  from our third-party service providers when they process
                  information on our behalf, including Anthropic, Supabase,
                  Resend, Vercel and Google (see cl 7 of the Privacy Policy);
                  and
                </li>

                <li>
                  from other lawful sources where reasonably necessary for our
                  business activities.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>5. Why we collect, use and disclose personal information</h3>

              <p>
                We may collect, use and disclose personal information to:

                <li>
                  generate, store, retrieve and deliver reports, including by
                  email and saved report URL;
                </li>

                <li>

                  privacy requests and legal claims;
                </li>

                <li>
                  monitor, secure, troubleshoot, maintain and improve the
                  website, reports, user experience and business operations;
                </li>

                <li>
                  perform analytics and understand website usage and conversion
                  performance;
                </li>

                <li>
                  comply with legal, regulatory, taxation, accounting,
                  insurance and record-keeping obligations;
                </li>

                <li>protect our rights, property, systems and customers; and</li>

                <li>
                  carry out another purpose disclosed to you, with your consent
                  where required.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                We do not currently use customer email addresses for promotional
                marketing unless the person separately opts in or we otherwise
                have a lawful basis to do so. Transactional emails, such as
                payment confirmations, report links, service notices and
                responses to requests, are not promotional marketing.
              </p>

              <h3>6. AI and automated report generation</h3>

              <p>
                SpendShift uses Anthropic’s Claude Application Programming
                Interface (“API”) to assist with generating personalised
                reports. The audit answers and related instructions necessary
                to generate the report are transmitted to Anthropic for
                processing.
              </p>

              <p>
                The report is generated using automated technology and may
                contain errors, omissions, generalisations or estimates. The
                use of AI does not preclude you from being required to review
                the report critically and verify information before acting on
                it. You must do your own due diligence before seeking to rely
                on SpendShift reports or products.
              </p>

              <p>
                We do not intentionally use customer audit answers to train our
                own machine-learning model. Anthropic may process and
                temporarily retain API inputs and outputs in accordance with
                its commercial terms, privacy documentation and security
                practices.
              </p>

              <h3>7. Third-party service providers</h3>

              <p>
                We may disclose or make personal information available to
                service providers that help us operate SpendShift, including:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Anthropic PBC (“Anthropic”), for AI processing and report
                  generation;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Supabase Inc. (“Supabase”), for database and report storage;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Stripe Inc. (“Stripe”), for hosted checkout, payment
                  processing, fraud prevention, refunds and transaction
                  administration;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Apple Pay and participating financial institutions, when
                  Apple Pay is used through Stripe;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Plus Five Five Inc. (“Resend”), for sending transactional
                  emails and report links;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Vercel Inc. (“Vercel”), for website hosting, infrastructure,
                  security and performance;
                </li>
                <li>
                  Google Analytics and related Google LLC services, for website
                  analytics;
                </li>
                <li>
                  professional advisers, insurers, accountants, auditors and
                  lawyers; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  a purchaser, investor or successor in connection with a
                  proposed or completed sale, merger, restructure or transfer
                  of all or part of the business, subject to appropriate
                  confidentiality and legal safeguards.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                These providers may collect information directly from you or
                receive it from us. Their handling of information is also
                governed by their own terms and privacy policies.
              </p>

              <p>
                We may also be required to disclose information to regulators,
                courts, law-enforcement agencies and government bodies where
                compelled to do so by law.
              </p>

              <h3>8. Overseas processing and disclosure</h3>

              <p>
                Some of our service providers operate or use infrastructure
                outside Australia. As a result, personal information may be
                processed, accessed or stored in countries other than Australia,
                including the United States as well as other locations in which
                Anthropic, Stripe, Vercel, Supabase, Resend, Google or their
                subprocessors operate.
              </p>

              <p>
                The exact locations may change over time and may depend on
                provider infrastructure and the selected hosting region. Where
                required by law, we will take reasonable steps in the
                circumstances to protect sensitive information before making
                disclosures to an overseas recipient.
              </p>

              <h3>9. Storage and retention</h3>

              <p>
                Generated reports, audit answers, associated email addresses
                and relevant transaction identifiers are stored in Supabase.
                Each report is generated once and may be accessed again through
                its saved report URL.
              </p>

              <p>
                Our current retention practice is to retain these records
                indefinitely unless they are manually deleted, deletion is
                requested and accepted, or deletion is otherwise required by
                law. We may also retain records for legal, security,
                fraud-prevention, accounting, taxation, insurance,
                dispute-resolution and business-continuity purposes.
              </p>

              <p>
                Because indefinite retention creates additional privacy and
                security risk, this retention policy should be reviewed
                periodically. Where the Privacy Act requires us to destroy or
                de-identify personal information that is no longer needed for
                a permitted purpose, we will take reasonable steps to do so.
              </p>

              <h3>10. Report links and access security</h3>

              <p>
                A saved report URL may allow access to the report without a user
                account or password. You are responsible for keeping that URL
                confidential and for not sharing it with anyone you do not want
                to access the report.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you believe a report link has been disclosed, accessed
                without permission or otherwise compromised, contact us
                promptly. We may disable, replace or delete a report link where
                reasonably necessary, but we cannot guarantee that a report
                accessed or copied by another person can be retrieved or
                erased.
              </p>

              <h3>11. Security</h3>

              <p>
                We take reasonable administrative, technical and organisational
                steps to protect personal information from misuse,
                interference, loss and unauthorised access, modification or
                disclosure. Measures may include access controls,
                service-provider security features, encryption in transit,
                environment separation, logging, monitoring and restricted
                administrative access.
              </p>

              <p>
                No website, database, transmission or storage system is
                completely secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security. You
                should use a secure device and network and protect any email
                account or report URL used to access your report.
              </p>

              <h3>12. Cookies and analytics</h3>

              <p>
                We and our service providers may use cookies, pixels, local

                accounting, security, fraud-prevention or dispute-resolution
                purposes. If we refuse a request, we will explain the reason
                where required.
