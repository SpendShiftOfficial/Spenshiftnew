<h2>
Saving more usually starts with fixing the leaks, not tracking
every cent.
</h2>

<p>
When living costs rise, it is easy to focus on tiny purchases
because they are visible. But the more useful question is often:
<strong> where is money leaving repeatedly without giving you enough value?</strong>
</p>

<p>
A phone plan that no longer suits you, an insurance policy you
automatically renew, unused subscriptions or frequent convenience
purchases can all quietly increase your monthly expenses. The goal
is not to make life miserable. It is to make sure your money is
going toward things you actually value.
