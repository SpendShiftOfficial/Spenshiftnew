              <h3>4. Google Analytics</h3>

              <p>
                We use Google Analytics to understand how people use the
                website. Google Analytics may collect information such as IP
                address, device and browser details, approximate location, pages
                viewed, events, referral source and timestamps.
              </p>

              <p>
                Google may process this information in accordance with its own
                terms and privacy documentation. We use analytics to improve the
                website, measure conversion performance and diagnose usability
                issues.
              </p>

              <h3>5. Stripe Checkout</h3>

              <p>
                Payment checkout is hosted by Stripe. When you enter Stripe
                Checkout, Stripe may set cookies or use similar technologies for
                payment functionality, authentication, security, fraud
                prevention and regulatory compliance.
              </p>

              <p>
                Stripe’s cookies and data handling are governed by Stripe’s own
                policies. SpendShift does not control cookies used on
                Stripe-hosted pages.
              </p>

              <h3>6. Your choices</h3>

              <p>You can manage cookies by:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  using any cookie or consent controls displayed on the website;
                </li>

                <li>
                  changing browser settings to block, restrict or delete
                  cookies;
                </li>

                <li>using browser privacy or tracking-protection features;</li>

                <li>using available Google Analytics opt-out tools; or</li>

                <li>
                  avoiding Stripe Checkout if you do not wish to accept
                  technologies required for payment, noting that this will
                  prevent purchase.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Blocking cookies may affect website functionality, analytics
                accuracy, fraud prevention and checkout.
              </p>

              <h3>7. Do Not Track and similar signals</h3>

              <p>
                Some browsers send “Do Not Track” or similar signals. There is
                no universally accepted technical standard for responding to all
                such signals. We may not respond to every signal, but you may
                use the controls described above.
              </p>

              <h3>8. Updates</h3>

              <p>
                We may update this Cookie Policy when technologies, providers or
                legal requirements change. The updated version will be
                published on the website.
              </p>
